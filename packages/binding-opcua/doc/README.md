# binding-opcua — design notes

Background for reviewers and for whoever maintains this binding next. The user-facing
documentation is in [../README.md](../README.md); these pages explain _why_ the binding behaves
as it does, and where it knowingly differs from the specifications.

## The one thing to know first

An OPC UA value crosses **two** converters, and only one of them belongs to this binding:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph READ["Read"]
        direction LR
        S1[(OPC UA server)] -->|DataValue| B1["binding<br/>DataValue → bytes"]
        B1 -->|Content| C1["core: InteractionOutput.value()<br/>ContentSerdes: bytes → value"]
        C1 -->|value| A1([application])
    end
    subgraph WRITE["Write"]
        direction LR
        A2([application]) -->|value| C2["core: ConsumedThing.writeProperty()<br/>ContentSerdes: value → bytes"]
        C2 -->|Content| B2["binding<br/>bytes → DataValue"]
        B2 -->|DataValue| S2[(OPC UA server)]
    end
```

The binding controls the encoding on read and the decoding on write. The other half is core's
`ContentSerdes`, which picks a codec by media type for the whole servient. That is why
`application/octet-stream` used to reach the codec that packs Modbus registers, and why the
binding now registers its own codec for the `opc.tcp` scheme (core issue #1409, PR #1572).

## What is special about OPC UA here

-   **The server, not the Thing Description, knows the type.** Every value read carries its OPC UA
    DataType, and the node's DataType can be read before a write. The TD's `type` is a description
    for consumers, not the source of truth for decoding.
-   **OPC UA already defines JSON encodings of its own**, including which media type means what
    (OPC 10000-6 §7.4.2, Table 80). The binding follows those rather than inventing a scheme,
    except where a WoT consumer would be left with something it cannot use — see
    [decisions.md](decisions.md).
-   **The type system is wider than JSON's.** 64-bit integers, ByteStrings, NodeIds, LocalizedTexts,
    structures (ExtensionObjects), arrays and matrices all have to survive a round trip through a TD
    that can only describe JSON. [content-negotiation.md](content-negotiation.md) has the measured
    results per type.
