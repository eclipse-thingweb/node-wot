# node-wot Examples

## Script Examples

Script examples are located in

-   `src\scripts`
-   `src\testthing`

The idea of these folders is to use TypeScript to work on the examples which offers support in being up-to-date with the current API.

see https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/node-wot/issues/171.

### Workflow

1. Run `npm run build`
2. Remove the following 3/4 lines in JS files of folder `dist/`

```
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
require("wot-typescript-definitions");
let WoT;
let WoTHelpers;
```

3. Copy the according JS file(s) to

-   `<node-wot>/examples/scripts`
-   `<node-wot>/examples/testthing`

## Test Thing

Test thing and client is located in `src\testthing`.
