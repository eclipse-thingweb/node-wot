You can access all node-wot functionality through the "Wot" global object:

## Example and live demo

An example of how to use node-wot as a browser-side library can be found under `https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/node-wot/blob/master/examples/browser/index.html`.
To run it live, open [`examples/browser/index.html`](http://plugfest.thingweb.io/webui/) in a modern browser,
and consume the test Thing available under `http://plugfest.thingweb.io:8083/testthing` to interact with it.
