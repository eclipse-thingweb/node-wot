## Prerequisites

Setup node-wot as described at the [node-wot main page](./../../README.md).

## Run Samples

There are sample implementations provided in the [example/scripting folder](./examples/scripts):

* example-mqtt-publish.js: Shows when node-wot act as a MQTT Client that publish data (latest counter value) to a broker. In the same time the client setup an action (reset counter) that can be initated by another MQTT client by sending a publication message to this action based topic. Please note to provide MQTT broker details (host, port, [username], [password], [clientId]) in the wot-servient.conf.json:


```
{
    "mqtt" : {
        "host" : "mqtt://test.mosquitto.org",
        "username" : "username",
        "password" : "password",
		"clientId" : "uniqueId",
        "port": 1883 
    }
}

```

Start the script by the command `wot-servient mqtt-publish.js` or `node ../../packages/cli/dist/cli.js mqtt-publish.js`.

* example-mqtt-subscription.js: Shows how node-wot consumes a Thing Description to do MQTT subscription on the provided event (=latest counter value) as well as initat the action (reset counter).

Start the script by the command `wot-servient -c mqtt-subscribe.js` or `node ../../packages/cli/dist/cli.js -c mqtt-subscribe.js`.
