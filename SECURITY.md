_ISO 27005 defines vulnerability as:
"A weakness of an asset or group of assets that can be exploited by one or more threats."_

## Eclipse Foundation Security Team

The Eclipse Foundation Security Team provides help and advice to Eclipse projects on security issues and is the first point of contact for handling security vulnerabilities. Members of the Security Team are selected from committers on Eclipse Projects, members of the [Eclipse Architecture Council](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#roles-ac), and Eclipse Foundation staff.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be reported either via email to [security@eclipse-foundation.org](mailto:security@eclipse-foundation.org) or directly with a project via the Eclipse Foundationâ€™s [issue tracker](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/new?issuable_template=new_vulnerability).

The general [security team email address](mailto:security@eclipse-foundation.org) can also be used to report vulnerabilities. Members of the Eclipse Foundation Security Team will receive messages sent to this address. This address should be used only for reporting undisclosed vulnerabilities; regular issue reports and questions unrelated to vulnerabilities in Eclipse Foundation project software will be ignored. Note that this email address is not encrypted.

## Disclosure

Disclosure is initially limited to the reporter, the project team and the Eclipse Foundation Security Team, but is expanded to include other individuals, and the general public. The timing and manner of disclosure is governed by the [Eclipse Foundation Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php).

Publicly disclosed issues are listed on the [Known Eclipse Security Vulnerabilities](https://www.eclipse.org/security/known.php) page.
