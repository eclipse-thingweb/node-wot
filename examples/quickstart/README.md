# Quick Start Things

This set of Things can be used to build mashup applications for a smart home scenario.
These Things are:

-   Simple coffee machine that can take an order to brew a coffee.
-   Presence sensor that emits an event when a person is detected.
-   Smart clock that runs 60 times faster than real time, where 1 hour happens in 1 minute.

These Things are hosted under https://www.thingweb.io/services, but can also be self-hosted.
